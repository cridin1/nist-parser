            "C.2 DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS OF CYBER RESILIENCY Any discussion of cyber resiliency is distinguished by its focus and a priori threat assumptions. These are reflected in cyber resiliency constructs and engineering practices. \u2022 Focus on the mission or business functions. Discussions of cyber resiliency focus on capabilities supporting organizational missions or business functions in order to maximize the ability of organizations to complete critical or essential missions or business functions despite an adversarial presence in their systems and infrastructure threatening mission-critical systems and system components. This is in contrast to focusing on the protection of information or on ensuring capabilities in a non- adversarial environment. It is also in contrast to focusing on ensuring the resilience of system elements or of constituent systems in a system-of-systems. From the perspective of cyber resiliency, system elements or constituent systems that are less critical to mission or business effectiveness can be sacrificed to contain a cyber-attack and maximize mission assurance. \u2022 Assume a changing environment. Discussions related to cyber resiliency assume ongoing and episodic changes in the threat environment, the operational environment, and the technical environment. APT actors learn from experience. Their motives can change in response to economic and political factors, and their TTPs can become commodity tools for lower-level actors. The ways technology is used by individuals and organizations change due to events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, broader or more cost-effective availability of services such as cloud computing, and growing familiarity with and acceptance of newer technologies. The technical environment continues to evolve, such as with the rapid convergence of information technology and operational technology, the increasing maturity of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and the transition to zero trust architectures. These changes can interact in many ways, increasing the complexity and reducing the transparency of systems, services, infrastructures, and ecosystems. From the perspective of cyber resiliency, changes can simultaneously present risks and opportunities for risk reduction. Risk management needs to consider differences in scale and time frame. \u2022 Focus on the effects of the advanced persistent threat."

However, the analysis can be applied to other types of operational technologies on a case-by-case basis. 151 Operational technology (OT) encompasses a broad range of programmable systems or devices that interact with the physical environment (or manage devices that interact with the physical environment). These systems/devices detect or cause a direct change through the monitoring and/or control of devices, processes, and events. Examples include industrial control systems, building management systems, transportation systems, physical access control systems, physical environment monitoring systems, and physical environment measurement systems. 152 See Appendix F for definitions and a description of the general methodology. electronic devices (IEDs); operator interfaces and monitoring; data collection (real-time and historical) and monitoring; and alarm systems - Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) and protection systems - Engineering and maintenance systems In general, the systems or devices on the OT network have limited storage capacity, and capabilities for monitoring and self-analysis are limited to providing basic health and status data. The OT network may also have limited bandwidth or may be functionally segmented into higher-bandwidth subnets within remote facilities with lower-bandwidth connectivity between facilities. Human-machine interfaces (HMIs) can be part of these types of devices or systems. While security products and training for the ICS domain are becoming more sophisticated, it should generally not be assumed that a well-resourced cadre of cyber defenders can operate on the OT network."
